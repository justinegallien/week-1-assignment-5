      <h3>Basic Git Commands</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Setting Up:</strong><br />
        git init: Initializes a new Git repository in a directory. This is the
        first command you'll use to start version control for a project. git
        config: Sets configuration options for Git, such as your username and
        email. This is important for identifying your commits.
        <br />
        <strong>Working with Changes:</strong> <br />git add: Stages changes for
        commit. You can add specific files or all changes in a directory. git
        commit: Saves the staged changes with a descriptive message. This
        creates a new version in your project's history. git status: Shows the
        current state of your repository, including which files have been
        modified or staged. git diff: Displays the differences between your
        working directory and the staged changes, or between different commits.
        <br /><strong>Branching and Merging:</strong><br />git branch: Lists,
        creates, or deletes branches. Branches allow you to work on different
        features or bug fixes in isolation. git checkout: Switches to a
        different branch. git merge: Combines changes from one branch into
        another. <br /><strong>Remote Repositories: </strong><br />git clone:
        Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. git push:
        Uploads local commits to a remote repository. git pull: Downloads
        changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current
        branch.<br />
        <strong>Viewing History: </strong><br />git log: Shows the commit
        history of your project. You can customize the output to see different
        levels of detail.

      <p>
        <strong>Navigation and File Management</strong><br />

        ls: Lists the files and directories in the current directory. You can

        directory you want to move to.<br />

        mkdir: Creates a new directory.<br />
        rmdir: Removes an empty directory.<br />

        mv: Moves or renames files or directories.<br />
